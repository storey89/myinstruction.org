					WELCOME TO DOGFEST 2021
				</h1>
<!-- This h1 tag is for the header of the dogfest site. I haven't attached any ids or classes to it, because since these elements are used only one, I thought using the html element tags in CSS would be fine. I'd say this technique would be fine in the case of a whole website using the same font through out, but if, I had more variations to the text, i'd use a class or an id to style them. -->

<!-- Container for images and they're styled using the classes for styling in CSS. Throughout this dive and nested divs , I've chosen to use classes, because they're used over an over again. Unlike id, which is for a single use. I had originally set the size of the images here in the tags, but in order to make the site a bit more responsive, I removed the inline styling and decided to use external styling for the image sizes throughout the project.  -->
